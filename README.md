# Elite Dangerous - Trade Helper

## Description
A windows window application to aid in the game Elite Dangerous with Trade calculations.

## From the creator:
I'm learning how to use Git and I'm not entirely good at using Visual Studio or C++. I will learn as I create this program and any improvement to the program is welcome, as long as you explain why your improvement is better than mine. Just fork or give a direct line of what needs to be changed in files.

## Installation
Download binary file and run. No installation necessary. The program will create a file to save your trade route information which you can choose to save somewhere.

## Usage
Program has to be written first.

## Download and Compile
Creator is running MS Visual Studio Community 2015.
Project is running C++ with CLR.
You need to set the project linker settings > SubSystem Windows, and Advanced > Entry Point to main.

## Contributing
The VS project file should not be committed by anyone but creator. You may open and use it but avoid saving and commiting it.
Suggest code improvement where due and provide a good description of why. I don't know code that well so it's good to learn for me.
